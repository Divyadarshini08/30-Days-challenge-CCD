**Day 1** of 30-days challenge - CCD

Here's the question in two lines:

**PL Ticket**
Out of N students who want to attend an IPL match, only M tickets are available. How many students wonâ€™t be able to book tickets?

**Approach**

1. Read the number of test cases
2. Loop through each test case
3. Read number of students and available tickets
4. Calculate the difference (students - tickets)
5. If the difference is positive, print it
6. Else, print 0 (all students get tickets)
